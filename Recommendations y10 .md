# Recommendations task Controlled Assessment #

You must prepare some recommendations for the organisers. Make sure that you use examples from your model and that you explain your recommendations.
The recommendations will be sent to each of the organisers to be viewed on screen. 

#Tip
*** Try using rehearse timings (slide show ----> rehearse timings ----> then click through at the speed you need it to run at)

# Requirements
The recommendations must include:

* the logo and strapline

* suggestions for the event - 

* ticket price, stall/pitch price

* 	Food options, activities offered

* 	Show answers to the what if questions

* values from your model to support your recommendations

* 	Show screenshots or copies of tables with relevant data

* charts to illustrate your findings.
Â 
Remember you will not be there to answer any questions. Make sure you explain your recommendations clearly.  

**------>>> Why not use animations and text boxes and arrows to highlight key points and key areas of charts?**

Prepare the recommendations.

Ask for feedback from your teacher and test buddy. Make changes if necessary.

Check that your sources table is up-to-date.

Save your report in your Activity2 folder.

Answer the questions about your recommendations in your Activity 2 review.
