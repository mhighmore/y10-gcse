# Ethical dilemmas of ICT

You are writing a report to government about the key ethical issues of ICT in the 21st century.

## Here are a couple of issues to consider:
## 1. Self driving cars

What are the ethical questions of self driving cars?  What decisions do they have to make?  Should they be allowed to act illegally?  How could this have unintended consequences?

Write a report on the possible implications for society and what should be done to get the best outcome for all.

## 2. Apps that remind us to be good:
http://www.crazyengineers.com/threads/romantimatic-app-on-ios-is-great-for-valentines-day-sms-reminder-and-for-later-too.73245/

What are your thoughts on this app?  Does an app to remind people to act in nice ways make the actions less good?  Or is this ok as it will increase happiness in society?

What if the app did these messages automatically without the users intervention? How would we feel then?
Write a brief report on how you feel about these types of apps.

## Research 2 more ethical dilemmas of ICT use in society.
* Write up this a report in word.
* Think of the pros and cons of each use of ICT.
* Include a bibliography with sources noted, e.g. webpage address and title.
* Use the ‘reference → insert footnote’ feature of word to do your bibliography.
* Use youtube video urls for video sources (link to the section of the video that was useful)

## Possible other dilemmas:
* Knowing someone's password and log in to a website, then accessing it without their consent. 
* A parent snooping on their child’s email/social networking accounts to keep them safe - invasion of privacy vs risks of online exploitation.
* Google glass - videoing people without consent, getting info in exams, distraction - how would we concentrate?
* Robot warriors/ drone strikes : remote controlling a device which can kill.
